# SQL Learning Path

Welcome to the SQL section of the Data Science Roadmap repository! This folder is dedicated to my learning journey as someone who wants to deepen their understanding in the data science field. It covers SQL from the basics to mastery, including essential concepts and advanced techniques required for data manipulation, analysis, and database management.

## What This Repo Is About

- **SQL Basics**: Introduction to databases, SQL syntax, and basic queries.
- **Data Filtering & Aggregation**: Using `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `ORDER BY` clauses.
- **Joins & Relationships**: Understanding `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL JOIN`, and `SELF JOIN`.
- **Subqueries & Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Enhancing query efficiency and readability.
- **Window Functions**: Using `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, and other analytical functions.
- **Indexes & Performance Optimization**: Improving query speed with indexing and optimization techniques.
- **Stored Procedures & Triggers**: Automating SQL tasks with procedural elements.
- **Advanced SQL Techniques**: Recursive queries, dynamic SQL, and handling complex datasets.

## How to Use This Section

- Follow the structured learning materials in sequential order.
- Practice with included SQL exercises and real-world scenarios.
