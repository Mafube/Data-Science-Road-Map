# SQL Learning Path

Welcome to the SQL section of the Data Science Roadmap repository! This folder documents my journey to mastering SQL, covering everything from the basics to advanced techniques for data manipulation, analysis, and database management.

## What is SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It's essential for tasks like data extraction, transformation, and analysis, playing a crucial role in data science, business intelligence, and backend development.

### Why SQL?

SQL is widely popular because it:
- Provides access and manipulation of data in relational databases
- Supports embedding in other programming languages
- Enables creation of tables, views, and stored procedures
- Includes powerful performance optimization and permission-setting capabilities

### How SQL Works

When an SQL command is executed, the RDBMS processes the request, using components like the Query Dispatcher and Optimization Engines to carry out the task efficiently.

## Repository Focus

- **SQL Basics**: Introduction to syntax and basic queries
- **Data Filtering & Aggregation**: Using `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `ORDER BY`
- **Joins**: Understanding `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL JOIN`
- **Subqueries & CTEs**: Optimizing query structure for performance
- **Window Functions**: Analytical functions like `RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`
- **Performance Optimization**: Techniques such as indexing and query tuning
- **Advanced Techniques**: Recursive queries, dynamic SQL, and handling complex datasets

## Learning Approach

To deepen my understanding of SQL, I will be using **Jupyter Notebooks** to explore concepts through hands-on coding. The notebooks will cover:
- Basic SQL queries (SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, etc.)
- Data aggregation (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
- Grouping and filtering techniques
- Database management and relational concepts
