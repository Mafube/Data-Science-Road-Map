# SQL Learning Path

Welcome to the SQL section of the Data Science Roadmap repository! This folder is dedicated to my learning journey as someone who wants to deepen their understanding in the data science field. It covers SQL from the basics to mastery, including essential concepts and advanced techniques required for data manipulation, analysis, and database management.

## What is SQL

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It enables users to create, read, update, and delete data, making it an essential tool for data analysis, business intelligence, and backend development. SQL is widely used in data science, allowing professionals to extract insights and perform complex queries efficiently.
